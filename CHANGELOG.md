### Technical Architecture
- **Multi-tier caching**: LRU cache (1000 items) → Memory index → SQLite FTS5 → SEC API
- **Performance targets**: <0.1ms cached lookups, ~2ms cold starts
- **Data coverage**: 13,000+ public companies from official SEC registry
- **Memory footprint**: ~15-30MB typical, ~50MB peak during updates
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (only requests for HTTP calls)

### Supported Platforms
- **Python versions**: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Operating systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Architectures**: x86_64, ARM64

### Performance Benchmarks (Intel i7 8-core, NVMe SSD)
- **Ticker lookup**: ~0.1ms (cached), ~2ms (cold)
- **CIK lookup**: ~0.1ms (cached), ~2ms (cold)
- **Fuzzy name search**: ~0.3ms (cached), ~5ms (cold)
- **Batch operations (1000x)**: ~45-120ms depending on operation
- **Data update**: ~1.8s for full SEC dataset
